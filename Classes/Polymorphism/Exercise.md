# Exercise Polymorphism

### Create new Dinosaur
Create a new Dinosaur (e.g Brachiosaurus, Ankylosaurus etc) that extends Dinosaur.

### Create and use an interface 
Your Dinosaur should implement a new interface that **you** create.  

### Add your Dinosaur to the DinosaurStudy class 
Include your Dinosaur in the DinosaurStudy class and have the information about it printed to the terminal. 

### Reflect
Reflect upon how the process of adding a dinosaur is easier due to inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism. What would you need to do to create two new Dinosaurs with all the same attributes as in the Dinosaur class but we hadn't used abstract classes, interfaces etc?
